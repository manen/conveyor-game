# `conveyor-game`

the yet unnamed conveyor-based factory game i'm working on

![screenshot of the game, conveyors visible, transporting raw iron and coal](./misc/screenshot.png)

## under development

[![Rust](https://github.com/manen/conveyor-game/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manen/conveyor-game/actions/workflows/rust.yml) ![source lines of code for the game](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/manen/conveyor-game)

the game is not really playable in its current state. if you wish to try the game anyway, builds are compiled on every commit using [github actions](https://github.com/manen/conveyor-game/actions)

### features

- tiles, buildings
- flexible game providers with on-thread and off-thread ticking
- saving to file, loading
